<p>
The Apache Tomcat Project is proud to announce the release of version 9.0.16
of Apache Tomcat. The notable changes compared to 9.0.14 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the packaged version of the Tomcat Native Library to 1.2.21 to pick
    up the memory leak fixes when using NIO/NIO2 with OpenSSL.</li>
<li>Remove extras (JMX remote listener and web services object factories) and
    merge them back into the core build.</li>
<li>Correct a regression in the fix for 53737 that did not correctly scan the
    web application directory structure for JSPs.</li>
<li>Improve HTTP/2 timeout handling</li>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> There is a known regression in
<code>catalina.sh</code> script. In configurations that use a PID file
(configured via CATALINA_PID environment variable) a wrong PID value may
be written, or the file is not created at all. See bug <bug>63041</bug>
(and <bug>53930</bug>). The workaround is to use <code>catalina.sh</code>
file from Tomcat 9.0.13.
